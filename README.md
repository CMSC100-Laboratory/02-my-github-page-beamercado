Steps on how to create a GitHub page:

1. Create a repository named "<username>.github.io" (in this activity, the repository was automatically created after accepting the assignment in the GitHub Classroom).
2. Clone the repository to your local machine and configure Git (set username and email).
3. Create an index.html file containing the first page to be rendered in the website in your local repository. Then, push it to your GitHub repository.
4. Change the visibility of the GitHub repository to public and set the appropriate branch to use for hosting the website.

What are your key takeaways from this exercise?

- You could make a decent static website using HTML and CSS, even without the use of frequently used frameworks and JavaScript (JS). On another note, I now appreciate the usage of JS more.
- I only learned about GitHub Pages through this exercise. I think they are a great platform to host a static website especially since they offer free hosting.
